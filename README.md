Implement on-page SEO by optimizing keywords related to your software’s unique features and target industries. Create landing pages for different buyer personas.
   
   - **What SEO strategies would you use to ensure visibility in a competitive tech market?**
     - A combination of keyword research for high-intent and long-tail keywords, optimizing for voice search, and focusing on technical SEO (site speed, structured data, mobile optimization). Building backlinks from industry-relevant sources and publishing in-depth, technical content can also improve ranking in a competitive market.
   
   - **How would you incorporate technical SEO to optimize a website with multiple product pages?**
     - Ensure each product page is optimized with unique metadata, keyword-rich headers, and structured content. Use schema markup to provide search engines with more details about each product.
